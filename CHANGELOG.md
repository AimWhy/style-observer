# Change Log

## v0.1.2 (2025-10-08)

### Improvements

- Remove the `transitionrun` event listener if the browser is not affected by the `transitionrun` event loop bug by [@DmitrySharabin](https://github.com/DmitrySharabin) in [#127](https://github.com/LeaVerou/style-observer/pull/127).
- Improve browser bug detection by [@LeaVerou](https://github.com/LeaVerou) and [@DmitrySharabin](https://github.com/DmitrySharabin) in [#129](https://github.com/LeaVerou/style-observer/pull/129).
- Register properties by placing the corresponding `@property` rules in a CSS layer instead of less permissive `CSS.registerProperty` by [@DmitrySharabin](https://github.com/DmitrySharabin) in [#132](https://github.com/LeaVerou/style-observer/pull/132). The userâ€™s rules now have higher priority, and they can redefine already registered properties if needed.

- Fix race conditions in the reflow tests by [@DmitrySharabin](https://github.com/DmitrySharabin) in [#132](https://github.com/LeaVerou/style-observer/pull/132).
- Fix bug with `isRegisteredProperty()` argument by [@DmitrySharabin](https://github.com/DmitrySharabin) in [6e73d42](https://github.com/LeaVerou/style-observer/commit/6e73d427528ecc86d6c4c56d8c2aca8b5dc42ecd).

### Other
